explodeinstaller: ISO Extraction utility

This extraction utility has been writen to assist in the automated
re-creation of Slackware install CDs, although it may be useful for
other distributions.

It differs from other scripts in that it allows editing of all files
including the ramdisk contents without being root, and without resorting
to FUSE or ISO mounting.  It therefore stands some chance of working
on a Mac.
